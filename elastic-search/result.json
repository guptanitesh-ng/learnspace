After achieving adequate general and local anesthesia, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The left lower extremity was elevated and exsanguinated, and a prolonged period of elevation was carried out for exsanguination, along with the exsanguinated bandage, and then the thigh tourniquet was inflated to 275 mmHg. The left lower extremity was placed back down on the table, and the operative site was exposed. "
