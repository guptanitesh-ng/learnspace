My name is Renu Khushwaha. My husband Late Mr. Gajendra Khushwaha died on 16 February 2021. His employee number is 50376542350. He was working as HTTE Hapur. With reference to the settlement activities, I want the following information –
1.	By when the medical identity card will be issued for my family? Request you to provide a date.
2.	I am entitled to recieve a family identity card which is a prerequisite to get a complimentary pass. By which date is the family identity card expected to be issued?
3.	At the time of payout settlement, a deduction of Rs.50000 was made as security charges. As per the guidelines this should have been cleared within six months from the time of death of the employee. As evident it’s been well beyond six months now and the security money has not been cleared yet. Kindly provide a date by when it would be paid.
5.  Please disburse the PLB bonus amount for FY 20-21 as it has not been done yet.
6.  Additionally, please provide contact details of the authority to approach in case above requests are not fulfilled in due time.
